# Typography

Typography is an integral part of web design, playing an important role in conveying a company’s message, setting the tone and enhancing the overall user experience. 

Typography is an important tool for guiding users through website design, helping to channel their attention to the most important elements on the page. The right typography choices can help to make a website appear easier to read, friendlier and more professional. 

It can also help to create a visual brand identity, with the right typefaces being associated with a particular brand or look and feel. When employed correctly, typography may be almost invisible to the user, yet its impact remains essential, helping to effectively communicate a website's content and create an impressive, aesthetically pleasing design for users to enjoy.

Rosalind uses a Fluid Typography system (Responsive Type). Fluid typography refers to the practice of using a type system that scale in size according to the size of the user's screen or device. 

The type system in Rosalind uses relative font sizes with a base font size of `16px`.

## Headings

Headings are an important element of web design, as they are the first thing that viewers often look at when they view a page. Not only do headings help to organize the page and make it easier to read, they can also draw people in and help to create an engaging experience. It is important to use headings effectively and to ensure that they provide structure and show clear hierarchies.

## Subtitles

Subtitles can be an integral part of a web design and should be thoughtfully placed and tailored to the overall message and content of your page. They can also be a great way to create structure and hierarchy within a page, making it easier to scan and navigate. When used strategically, subtitles can be an effective tool to enhance the user experience and engage visitors on your website.

## Eyebrow

Eyebrow text is a descriptive keyword or phrase placed above the main headline and blurb. It appears in a smaller font and sums up the content in just a few words. When users scan the headline, they'll also scan the eyebrow.

### Body

The body font in web design is a critical element that contributes to the overall aesthetics of a website. Using the right font can provide an inviting and clean environment, while using a wrong one can make it appear cluttered and difficult to read. Therefore, when designing a website, it is important to take time to select an appropriate font for the body that is both modern and legible, and that has the right size and line spacing.

## Caption

Caption fonts are used to provide concise yet descriptive text at a glance. Caption fonts are typically smaller than other text on the page and help provide context to specific element on a page, such as images or video content.

### Blockquote

The blockquote is a great web design tool to draw attention to key messages or visually break up large chunks of content. This gives the page an aesthetically pleasing look while also highlighting important points. 

By using the blockquote, designers can emphasize the words that they want to stand out, allowing them to control the focus of their reader’s attention and create an impactful design. Furthermore, the blockquote also enables designers to give quotes from reliable sources or draw upon emotion-evoking language to strengthen their design.
