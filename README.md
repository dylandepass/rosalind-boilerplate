## :star2: About the Project

When you are managing user experiences, it can be quite challenging to keep styles consistent and synchronized across multiple development platforms and devices. Rosalind offers a boilerplate setup to help get your company's design system started with an end-to-end designer/developer workflow across any platform.

With Rosalind, design decisions start in Figma, which is where designers feel most at home. They can then customize the design system to their liking and, with the click of a button, give developers access to these decisions in code on any platform iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML etc.

<!-- FAQ -->
## :grey_question: FAQ

- How do you managing the tokens?

  + The design tokens are managed in Figma and transformed into variable files (css, scss, swift etc) using [StyleDictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/). Currently rosalind is only setup to work with [Token Studio](https://docs.tokens.studio/) for Figma but could be setup to work with other token management software.

- How do you apply tokens to franklin blocks?

  + The tokens can be applied using standard css variables. Rosalind also includes a set of [mixins](https://dylandepass.github.io/rosalind-boilerplate/?path=/docs/docs-developers-mixins-introduction--docs) that can be used instead of css variables. These mixins abstract the complexities of having to remember token names.

- How do you keep the design and the code in sync?  i.e if a component gets a new token added/removed

  + Rosalind includes some utility scripts that can to detect if the core design system css is out of date with the tokens. [unused-variables.mjs](https://github.com/dylandepass/rosalind-boilerplate/blob/main/bin/unused-variables.mjs) will detect if a variable is not used in the core design system. For a lot of variables this is ok and expected. [validate-system.mjs](https://github.com/dylandepass/rosalind-boilerplate/blob/main/bin/validate-system.mjs) will check if any variables are used in the core design system that no longer exists. This check runs as part of CI and will stop a build if a token is not found.
